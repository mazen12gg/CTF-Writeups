Challenge Name: Crack the Gate 2

Challenge Information:
- Category: Web Exploitation  
- Difficulty: Medium  

---

Objective:
The goal of this challenge is to bypass the IP-based rate-limiting restriction and successfully authenticate.

---

Exploitation Steps:

1- Bypassing the IP-Based Rate Limit
Since the application appeared to trust user-controlled headers, I leveraged the `X-Forwarded-For` header to manipulate the source IP address.

The idea was to send each login attempt with a different IP value in order to bypass the rate-limiting restriction.

---

2- Automating the Attack
I intercepted the login request using **Burp Suite** and sent it to **Intruder**.

To synchronize password attempts with changing IP addresses, I selected the **Pitchfork attack** type.

This allowed me to:

- Assign one payload position to the `X-Forwarded-For` header (IP list)
- Assign another payload position to the password field (password list)
- Ensure that for every password attempt, a new IP address was used simultaneously

---

3- Identifying the Correct Password
After launching the attack, I analyzed the responses.

I monitored the **response length** column and noticed that:

- Most responses had identical content length (failed login attempts)
- One response had a different length

That deviation indicated a successful authentication attempt.

---

4- Retrieving the Flag
Using the identified password, I logged in successfully and retrieved the hidden flag.
